AnnaTurnerWebsite
=================

Simple photo portfolio for Anna Turner. Uses perl to serve up the html and uses a simple js plugin from malsup.github.io to cycle through them.

Unfortunately this repo is not live (does not auto-sync with the website) due to Anna using crazydomains and them not having git installed.
