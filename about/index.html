         <p>My name is Anna, my aim as a photographer is to know myself and others better. I am completely enamored by the unspeakable beauty that can be found in everyday life and equally fascinated by the darkness and heartache that accompanies what most would describe as a 'normal unremarkable' life.<br/>
This body of work is about aspects of life - All of it - the spectacularly beautiful elements of life as well as the heartbreakingly difficult. I am constantly left speechless by the beauty found in everyday life (light through the trees, or the way a glass makes a shadow in the kitchen). However I am equally as interested in the darker, more unpleasant aspects of the notion of everyday.<br/>
We all have our crosses to bear - life is rarely spotless for anyone, it is these 'tiny tragedies' that shape us and make us who we are. While the West Coast of Tasmania is incredibly beautiful in the middle of winter it can also be cold, harsh and desolate.</p>
 
<p>My aim in this project is to reveal the fragility in everyday life - the mundane in all it's spectacular beauty and all of it's heart wrenching challenges. The fragility that we all silently grapple with, yet rarely acknowledge. Society does not value mistakes or failure the way in which success is celebrated. As a result, this leaves no position for vulnerability - culminating in the honest, everyday aspects of life being often denied.<br/>
These struggles we face - be they broken hearts, self doubt, uncertainty, disappointment - are all veiled from society; yet I feel there is the potential and opportunity to present these facets of the through my work.<br/>
These seemingly banal elements of the everyday shape the human connection with these raw, desolate places - and are reflections of ordinary aspects of life we are all familiar with. Human experience is a duality. Whilst happiness and success are easily honored, life is all the more richer if we are able to honor our struggles as well.  </p>
